        <p>Hey there, I'm Ellen <span role="img" aria-label="hello emoji">ðŸ‘‹</span></p>

        <p>I'm a data-driven frontend developer currently based in the UK. Day-to-day, I turn coffee into TV apps at BT. Outside of the 9-5, I build small apps, blogs and websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.js. My work is all about leveraging the principles of human-centered design to ensure simple, brilliant, and accessible user experiences. So if you want to build an app all the technophobes in your family will love using, let's have a chat.</p>

        <p>Outside of my IDE, I'm also hugely passionate about seeing more diversity in tech spaces. Only 4% of software developers in the UK identify as female, and I'm keen to get involved in making that a much larger number. I am currently working with BT's inclusion and recruitment D&I groups to improve hiring, retention and workplace culture.</p>
